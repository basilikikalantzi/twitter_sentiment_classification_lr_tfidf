# English Tweets Sentiment Classifier

## Description
This project focuses on developing a sentiment analysis classifier for English tweets using a minimalistic approach with only Logistic Regression and TF-IDF vectorization.

## Technical Approach
By constraining the model to Logistic Regression paired with TF-IDF feature extraction, we provide a focused framework for examining fundamental NLP classification techniques while maintaining computational efficiency.

## Features
- **Lightweight model**: Uses only Logistic Regression for classification.  
- **Simple vectorization**: Employs TF-IDF to convert raw text into numerical features.  
- **Fast training & inference**: Minimal dependencies and low compute requirements.  

## Environment
This notebook was implemented on **Kaggle**, leveraging its pre-installed libraries and dataset handling utilities. If you run the notebook on another platform (e.g., Google Colab), you may need to install or upgrade some packages manually.
